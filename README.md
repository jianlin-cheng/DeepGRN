To generate the figures that we use in our experiment, please refer to [these instructions](analysis/README.md) to extract data from trained models and create the plot you are interested in.

## Prepare input features for training and prediction

The following sections are for users who wish to generate their own training/prediction dataset. If you are interested in the DREAM-ENCODE Challenge 2016 data that we use in our experiment, we have prepared the [step by step guideline](example/README.md) to generate the input for training and prediction.

### Genomic sequence

Genomic sequence is provided as fasta format. You can download these files from [UCSC Genome Browser](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html)
Please notice that if your validation chromosome name should be one of the chromosome names in this file.

### Chromatin accessibility data

Chromatin accessibility data should be prepared as BigWig format from DNase-Seq experiment. You should name your files as {cell_type}.1x.bw and put them into your/data/folder/DNase/  That is to say, one file for each cell type. These files should be generated from the read alignment files in the standard BAM file format. If you have replicates for the same cell type, you should first merge them with samtools:

```
samtools merge {cell_type}.bam {cell_type}.rep1.bam {cell_type}.rep2.bam
samtools index {cell_type}.bam
```

Then you can run the bamCoverage in [deeptools](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/bamCoverage.html) to generate the required .bw file for each cell type. Here we use human genome as example:

`bamCoverage --bam ${i}.bam -o ${i}.1x.bw --outFileFormat bigwig --normalizeTo1x 2478297382 --ignoreForNormalization chrX chrM --Offset 1 --binSize 1  --blackListFileName blacklist.bed.gz --skipNonCoveredRegions`

You can provide a BED or GTF file containing regions that should be excluded from bamCoverage analyses with the `--blackListFileName` option. For human genome hg19, we use the [low mapability region provided by UCSC Genome Browser](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeMapability/wgEncodeDacMapabilityConsensusExcludable.bed.gz) 

### Sequence uniqueness data [optional]
According to [UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg18&g=wgEncodeMapability). We use the Duke uniqueness score as an additional input. The Duke excluded regions track displays genomic regions for which mapped sequence tags were filtered out before signal generation and peak calling for Duke/UNC/UTA's Open Chromatin tracks. This track contains problematic regions for short sequence tag signal detection (such as satellites and rRNA genes). The Duke excluded regions track was generated for the ENCODE project.

The Duke uniqueness score tracks display how unique is each sequence on the positive strand starting at a particular base and of a particular length. Thus, the 35 bp track reflects the uniqueness of all 35 base sequences with the score being assigned to the first base of the sequence. Scores are normalized to between 0 and 1 with 1 representing a completely unique sequence and 0 representing the sequence occurs >4 times in the genome (excluding chrN_random and alternative haplotypes). A score of 0.5 indicates the sequence occurs exactly twice, likewise 0.33 for three times and 0.25 for four times. For Human genome, you can use the [Duke uniqueness tracks](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/encodeDCC/wgEncodeMapability/wgEncodeDukeUniqueness35bp.wig.gz)  generated for the ENCODE project as tools in the development of the Open Chromatin tracks. For other genomes, you can generate your own sequence uniqueness data following this rule and use [wigToBigWig](https://www.encodeproject.org/software/wigtobigwig/) to convert it to the BigWig format.

### Gene expression profile [optional]
Follwing the [FactorNet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202318303293) framework, we use the first eight principal components from the RNA-Seq experiments for each cell type. These principal components should be generated using the TPM(Transcripts Per Kilobase Million) with replicates merged by averging. You should save this input in your/data/folder/rnaseq_data.csv as a Comma Separated Values file with the first line indicate the type of the cells.

We provided a simple R script data/generate_pca.R to generate this data from TPM data. The input of this script should be a csv file containing a gene by cell type matrix with first row indicate the types of cell and the first column indicate the gene names. Usage:

`Rscript generate_pca.R [path/to/input.csv] [path/to/rnaseq_data.csv]`

### Genomic annotations [optional]
The annotation feature for each bin is encoded as a binary vector of length 6, with each value representing if there is an overlap between the input bin and each of the six genomic features (coding regions, intron, promoter, 5'/3'-UTR, and CpG island). For Human genome Hg19, we use annotations from the [FactorNet GitHub repo](https://github.com/uci-cbcl/FactorNet/tree/master/resources) to generate the required input and save them in example/hg19. For preparing this input for your own genome, you can use our python script: data/generate_annotation.py Usage:

`Python generate_annotation.py [gencode_path] [genome_sizes_file] [bed_file] [outfile]`

You should prepare your own (gzipped) bed files indicting the genomic features (coding regions, intron, promoter, 5'/3'-UTR, and CpG island) and save them as [cpgisland|cds|intron|promoter|utr5|utr3].bed.gz under the `gencode_path`. 

`genome_sizes_file` is the file containing size of each chromosome. For Hg19 the content is:

```
chr1	249250621
chr10	135534747
chr11	135006516
chr12	133851895
chr13	115169878
chr14	107349540
chr15	102531392
chr16	90354753
chr17	81195210
chr18	78077248
chr19	59128983
chr2	243199373
chr20	63025520
chr21	48129895
chr22	51304566
chr3	198022430
chr4	191154276
chr5	180915260
chr6	171115067
chr7	159138663
chr8	146364022
chr9	141213431
chrX	155270560
```

`bed_file` is the file indicating the target region and should be the same as the one you use for the prediction script.

## Prepare label data for custom training

In additional to the input feature information mentioned in [Prepare input features for training and prediction](#Prepare-input-features-for-training-and-prediction), you need to prepare the label information for training.

### label data

If you need to train your own models with custom data, instead of preparing a file indicating the target region, you should prepare a label file indicating the true labels of the binding status along the chromosome. In the DREAM-ENCODE challange, each bin falls into one of the three types: bound(B), unbound(U), or ambiguous(A), which is determined from the ChIP-Seq results. Bins overlapping with peaks and passing the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) check with a threshold of 5%  are labeled as bound. Bins that overlap with peaks but fail to pass the reproducibility threshold are labeled as ambiguous. All other bins are labeled as unbound. We do not use any ambiguous bins during the training or validation process according to the common practice. Therefore, each bin in the genomic sequence will either be a positive site (bounded) or a negative site (unbounded).
Example:

```
chr     start   stop    A549    H1-hESC HeLa-S3 HepG2   IMR-90  K562    MCF-7
chr10   600     800     U       U       U       U       U       U       U
chr10   650     850     U       U       U       U       U       U       U
chr10   700     900     U       U       U       U       U       U       U
chr10   750     950     U       U       U       U       U       U       U
chr10   800     1000    U       U       U       U       U       U       U
```

For each TF, you will need one such label file. You should save these (gzipped) label files under data_dir/label/train/ and name them as [TF_name].train.labels.tsv.gz

### Narrowpeak files for data augmentation during training [optional]

For TFs that have abundant binding sites, training performance and speed could benefit from sampling positive sample regions from the ChIP-Seq peak regions during each epoch. To do so, you would need to prepare a peak annotation file. We have provided the peak annotations as example/hg19/peak_annotation.gz for the TF and cells we used. For your own customized input, you can use data/generate_peaks.py to generate those peak annotations. Usage:

`Python generate_peaks.py [gencode_path] [genome_sizes_file] [bed_file] [outfile] [narrowPeak_path] [blacklist_file] [label_path] [label_peak_path] [genome_window_size] [flanking]`

[gencode_path] [genome_sizes_file] [bed_file] [outfile] are the same as described in the "Genomic annotations" section. 

narrowPeak_path is the path you store the ChIP-Seq narrowPeak files. In our experiment, these peaks are the reproducible peaks across pseudo-replicates that pass the 10% IDR threshold. The peaks are provided in the [narrowPeak format](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format12). For each cell type and TF pair, the file  should be named as  ChIPseq.[train_cell].[tf_name].conservative.train.narrowPeak.gz'

`blacklist_file` is the file you want to exclude during analysis and can be empty if you do not wish to miss any regions

`label_path` is where the label files are stored. They should be located in data_dir/label/train/

`label_peak_path` is where the output annotation files are stored. They should be located in data_dir/label/train_positive/

`genome_window_size` is the size of each bin in your label files. In our experiment we set it to 200.

`flanking` is the length of upstream and downstream region that around your training sample. In our experiment we set it to 401.

## Prepare target region for prediction

In additional to the input feature information mentioned in [Prepare input features for training and prediction](#Prepare-input-features-for-training-and-prediction), you need to specify your target region for prediction. The region to predict should be a bed format file indicate the region you wish to predict along the chromosome. If you use our trained model, we recommend you consider use 200bp for each prediction since the models are trained using this format. Example:

```
chr1	600	800
chr1	650	850
chr1	700	900
chr1	750	950
chr1	800	1000
```
